////
//// Configuration
////

//// For Linux configuration is done using Makefile. To get started type "make help".
////
//// For windows you need to set the right compiler switches manually:
////
//// -DNDEBUG       | Disable debugging mode. Use always.
////
//// -DIS_64BIT     | Compile in 64-bit mode. Use on 64-bit systems.
////
//// -DBIGENDIAN    | Should not be used on Windows
////
//// -DNO_PREFETCH  | Disable use of prefetch asm-instruction. A must if you want the
////                | executable to run on some very old machines.
////
//// -DUSE_BSFQ     | Use bsfq asm-instruction. Works only in 64-bit mode.
////                | Works with ICC and GCC, not with MSVC. Gives a small speed up.
////
//// -DUSE_POPCNT   | Add runtime support for use of popcnt asm-instruction.
////                | Works only in 64-bit mode. For compiling requires hardware
////                | with popcnt support. Around 4% speed-up.
